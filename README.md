# Learning how to Rust

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

- `println!` is not a normal function, it ends with a `!`, therefore, it is a macro
  - macros don’t always follow the same rules as functions.
- `;` to end lines
- Rust is an _ahead-of-time compiled_ language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.
